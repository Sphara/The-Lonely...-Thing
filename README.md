# The-Lonely...-Thing

A lonely thing. With ants, and badly-generated terrain, but made with love (And Unity !)

This is my first Unity game, i'm using it to learn C#/Unity engine so what i do with it won't make a lot of sense from players perspective...

Thanks to [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbWK8bCAU2w "I also love his work on procedural cave generation") for the controller & some other little bits i can't remember (i think it was some of his tutorials)
