# The-Lonely...-Thing

A lonely thing. With ants, and badly-generated terrain, but made with love (And Unity !)

This is my first Unity game, i'm using it to learn C#/Unity engine so what i do with it won't make a lot of sense from players perspective...

Thanks to [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan "wooooo") for the controller & some other little bits i can't remember (i think it was some of his tutorials) & [Kenneynl](http://kenney.nl/ "He's awesome !") for the art. [This](http://studentgamedev.blogspot.no/2013/08/unity-voxel-tutorial-part-1-generating.html) tutorial was also useful, but i ended up not using 3D meshes for now
